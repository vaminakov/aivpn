    /// LWW / tombstone-sticky conflict rule):
    /// - `id` — primary key / stable identity; the match key for merging.

    ///   nodes always agree on it, and a mismatch is a real (if
    ///   pathological) divergence worth surfacing, not one anti-entropy
    ///   could paper over anyway.
    /// - `name` — `existing.name = inc.name`.
    /// - `enabled` — the persisted field (post tombstone-derived rule:
    ///   `inc.enabled && !inc.deleted`).
    /// - `deleted` — the tombstone flag; exactly the convergent state a
    ///   peer's revocation must propagate.
    /// - `updated_at` — the LWW timestamp that decides convergence order.
    /// - `expires_at`, `device_pubkey`, `one_time` — synced explicitly per
    ///   the server-sec MEDIUM fix (previously silently dropped by merge,
    ///   see the comment above `existing.expires_at = inc.expires_at` in
    ///   `merge_from_json`).
    /// - `qos` — `existing.qos = inc.qos`.
    ///
    /// Excluded:
    /// - `stats` (bytes_in/out, last_connected, last_handshake,
    ///   total_connections) — purely local runtime counters.
    ///   `merge_from_json` never touches `stats` on an existing record, and
    ///   every node's traffic differs by definition, so including it would
    ///   make the digest differ between two fully-converged nodes forever,
    ///   permanently defeating the sync gate.
    /// - `vpn_ip` — despite looking like admin/identity state, this is NOT
    ///   part of the converging set: `merge_from_json`'s existing-record
    ///   branch never assigns `vpn_ip` (conspicuously absent from the field
    ///   list above), and by design the SAME logical client can legitimately
    ///   hold a DIFFERENT `vpn_ip` on two pool nodes forever — each node
    ///   allocates IPs from its own local counter, and an incoming record
    ///   whose `vpn_ip` collides with an unrelated local client is re-homed
    ///   onto a free local IP (see the comment in `merge_from_json`: "the
    ///   reassignment stays local ... so it doesn't churn"). Hashing
    ///   `vpn_ip` would make two nodes that have already reconciled every
    ///   field merge actually propagates show a perpetual digest mismatch,
    ///   triggering endless, pointless full-payload exchanges.
    /// - `created_at` — set once at creation and never reconciled by merge
    ///   (absent from its assignment list); excluded for the same
    ///   "not part of the authoritative/converging set" reason, though in
    ///   practice it never diverges once the initial record has propagated.
    ///
    /// ## Determinism
    /// - Records are sorted by `id` first, so the result does not depend on
    ///   in-memory/on-disk ordering (insertion/merge order is otherwise
    ///   whatever order operations happened in).
    /// - Every variable-length field (`id`, `name`, the `qos` JSON blob) is
    ///   length-prefixed with a little-endian `u32` before its bytes, and a
    ///   leading record count frames the whole structure — so e.g.
    ///   `[{id:"a"},{id:"bc"}]` cannot hash the same as
    ///   `[{id:"ab"},{id:"c"}]`.
    /// - `Option<DateTime<Utc>>` fields (`updated_at`, `expires_at`) are
    ///   encoded as an `i64` millisecond timestamp, with `i64::MIN` reserved
    ///   as the "None" sentinel (a real timestamp can never legitimately
    ///   encode to `i64::MIN` here).
    /// - `device_pubkey: Option<[u8; 32]>` is encoded as a single
    ///   present-flag byte followed by either the 32 key bytes or 32 zero
    ///   bytes, so "present with all-zero key" (impossible in practice, but
