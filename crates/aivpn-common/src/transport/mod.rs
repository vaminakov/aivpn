//! Datagram-transport abstraction.
//!
//! The AIVPN protocol is datagram-shaped end to end: resonance tags, the AEAD
//! nonce counter, MDH framing, the mask/mimicry layer and the FEC group all
//! operate on *one logical packet*. Everything above "send one datagram /
//! receive one datagram" is therefore transport-agnostic already — it just
//! happened to be written directly against `tokio::net::UdpSocket`.
//!
//! This module introduces that seam explicitly:
//!
//! ```text
//!   AIVPN protocol (crypto, tags, MDH, ratchet, enrollment, masks)  ← unchanged
//!  ──────────────────── trait DatagramTransport ─────────────────────
//!   UdpTransport (today)          │  alternative transports (later)
//! ```
//!
//! **This module adds no behaviour.** `UdpTransport` is a thin wrapper over the
//! very same connected `UdpSocket` the client already owned, calling the very
//! same `send()` / `recv()` methods. Not a byte on the wire changes.
//!
//! # Why `&self` and not `&mut self`
//!
//! The obvious sketch of this trait takes `&mut self`. That does not
//! survive contact with the client: the connected socket is shared by two
//! concurrently running tasks — the RX task parked in `recv()` and the upload
//! task calling `send()`. `tokio::net::UdpSocket` supports exactly that through
//! `&self`. Taking `&mut self` would force an `Arc<Mutex<..>>` around the
//! transport, and the RX task holds its borrow across an `await` that only
//! completes when a packet arrives — i.e. it would deadlock the uplink. So the
//! trait takes `&self`, and implementations are responsible for their own
//! interior synchronisation (a stream-oriented transport will need a send-side
//! mutex; UDP needs none).
//!
//! # Why `std::io::Result`
//!
//! The upload pipeline classifies send failures by `std::io::ErrorKind`
//! (`is_transient_send_error`: `NetworkUnreachable`, `PermissionDenied`, …) to
//! decide "drop this packet" vs "tear the session down". Returning the raw
//! `io::Error` keeps that classification byte-identical instead of flattening
//! it into a stringly-typed crate error.
