# AIVPN Server Production Dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for minimal image size

# Stage 1: Build
# rust:1.97-slim-trixie — current stable Rust on Debian 13 (trixie), matching
# the runtime stage below so the dynamically linked binary finds the same
# glibc. Keep both stages on the same Debian release when bumping either.

# Copy workspace (Cargo.lock pinned for reproducible release builds).
# The whole crates/ tree is copied rather than an explicit per-crate list:
# every workspace member in Cargo.toml must be present for cargo to resolve
# the workspace at all, so an enumerated list silently breaks the image the
# moment a member is added.

# Build in release mode with the committed Cargo.lock (--locked → reproducible).
# Full feature set so the image works with the web panel (management-api →
# /run/aivpn/api.sock), the metrics dashboard, and neural mask rotation —
# matching `make server`. Use a custom build for a minimal gateway.
RUN cargo build --locked --release --bin aivpn-server --features "management-api,metrics,neural"

# Stage 2: Runtime
# debian:trixie-slim — Debian 13, the current stable release (bookworm is now
# oldstable). Must stay on the same release as the builder stage above.
# TODO(security): pin with @sha256:<digest> once a digest is chosen to track
# (trixie-slim is a floating tag; a digest pin trades that for a manual
# bump on every base-image security update).
