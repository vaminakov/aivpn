/**
 * In-process sliding-window rate limiter (exact, timestamp-log based).
 *
 * A request is allowed iff fewer than `maxReqs` requests were ALLOWED in the
 * last `windowMs` milliseconds. Unlike a fixed window (which resets its
 * counter at window boundaries and therefore admits up to 2×maxReqs in any
 * `windowMs` span straddling a boundary), the sliding log enforces the limit
 * over every possible window position.
 *
 * Memory: at most `maxReqs` timestamps per key — rejected requests are not
 * recorded, so an attacker hammering one key cannot grow its entry.
 *
 * For multi-process deployments, swap checkRateLimit for a Redis-backed version.
